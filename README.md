# CFMT

fmt implemented in C

## Motivation

I'v been suffered from "%x", "%lx", "%llx" for a really long time. And I decided to end this.

## How to use this?

Take cfmt.c and cfmt.h to your project, and include cfmt.h, compile cfmt.c. That's all!

## How to format print a struct?

Well, this need more work. Anyway, currently, this is not supported.

## Example

See test.c
